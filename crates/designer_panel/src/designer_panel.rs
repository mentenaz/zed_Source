//! The Designer — a workspace tab that renders a `.flow.json` workflow as
//! a `gpui_flow` canvas: view, edit node properties, save, and run.
//!
//! Ported from `E:\Forge_GPUI\src\forge_shell\panels\designer_panel\`,
//! narrowed to the workflow-JSON half only (`.fdgn`/legacy ForgeFlow was
//! never vendored into this tree — see `gpui_flow`/`workflow_engine`'s own
//! module docs). Unlike `flows_panel` (a `workspace::dock::Panel`), this
//! is a per-file `workspace::item::Item` — opened once per flow, not a
//! persistent sidebar.
//!
//! Positions round-trip through the `.flow.layout.json` sidecar
//! (`workflow_engine::layout`), never through `Action::pos` — see
//! `workflow_json`'s module doc. A flow with no sidecar yet gets a
//! layered auto-layout (`workflow_json::auto_layout`, built on
//! `workflow_engine::compute_levels`) instead of the placeholder stack.
//!
//! Property editing is deliberately plain-text (every `FlowNode.property`
//! value is a string, parsed back to JSON on save via `string_to_value`)
//! rather than a typed widget per `registry::FieldKind` — matches
//! `flows_panel`'s own "everything as text for now" pragmatism; a typed
//! form is a natural follow-up, not required to make editing usable.
