# flows_panel

A left-dock panel listing every workflow (`.flow.json`) in the open
workspace, with buttons to create, open and run them.

## Why it exists

Flows are files, and files get lost in a tree. This panel is the index: one
place that shows which workflows a project has, when each last ran and how it
went, and that can start one without opening it first.

Ported from Forge, limited to the `.flow.json` format. Forge's older
`.fdgn`/`.fwrk` ForgeFlow format was never brought into this tree.

## Using it

Open with `ctrl-k f` (`cmd-k f` on macOS), the status bar icon (tooltip
"Flows"), or `flows panel: toggle focus`.

### Toolbar

| Button | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Refresh | Rescan the workflows directory |
| New Workflow | Create a blank `.flow.json` and open it |
| Add Task Chain | Scan the workspace for services and generate a flow that starts them |

### Each row

| Button | Does |
| --- | --- |
| Run | Run the flow now; the row shows the outcome of the last run |
| Open | Open the flow through the normal file-open path |
| Graph | Open the flow on the Designer canvas directly |

Both buttons end up on the Designer canvas: the Designer claims every
`.flow.json` file, so the normal file-open path leads there too. To see the
raw JSON, use the **Raw** button in the Designer's toolbar.

Rows are sorted by name.

### Add Task Chain

The wizard lists the services detected in the workspace. For each one you can
adjust the Name, Command, Args, Working Dir and Port, tick or untick it, or
remove it. **Add Custom Service** adds a blank row. **Create** writes a new
flow that starts the selected services; **Cancel** discards it.

The Node panel's **Task Chain** quick action opens this same wizard anchored
to that project.

## Where flows are stored

In `.zed/workflows` under the workspace root by default. The directory is
created on first use. Change it in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "flows": {
    "workflows_dir": "automation/flows"
  }
}
```

The path is relative to the workspace root.

## How it is wired

- `flows_panel::init(cx)` registers `flows_panel::ToggleFocus`.
- `FlowsPanel::load(workspace, cx)` is awaited in `initialize_panels`
  (`crates/zed/src/zed.rs`), which also hands a `WeakEntity<FlowsPanel>` to
  the Node panel.
- Implements `workspace::dock::Panel`, fixed to the left dock,
  `activation_priority() = 13`.
- `open_task_chain_wizard_anchored(...)` is the public entry point other
  panels use to open the wizard for a specific project.

## Layout

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `src/flows_panel.rs` | Panel, flow list, task-chain wizard, run handling |
| `src/flows_settings.rs` | The `"flows"` settings key (`FlowsSettings`) |
| `src/persistence.rs` | Per-project run history |

Running a flow calls `workflow_engine::run_workflow` directly and records the
result. History is kept in Zed's scoped key-value store under the workspace
root, as `history:<flow_id>`, capped at `MAX_HISTORY_ENTRIES` per flow.

Related crates: [`workflow_engine`](../workflow_engine/README.md) (execution)
and [`designer_panel`](../designer_panel/README.md) (the canvas).

## Differences from Forge

- No favourites, tags or separate flows index table.
- Runs started here record final per-action outcomes only. For live
  per-action status, run the flow from the Designer.

## Development

```sh
cargo check -p flows_panel -j 8
cargo test -p flows_panel -j 8
```

The tests cover run-history persistence, and that the Designer's database
table has a single owner (`designer_panel`).

To run the tests of every fork crate at once: `script/test-fork-crates.ps1`.
